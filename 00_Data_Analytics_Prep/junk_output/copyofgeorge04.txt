[01] kenneth clarke economies still in grave danger of collapse
[02] 
[03] western economies remain in grave danger of financial
[04] collapse and next week s spending review is vital if britain
[05] is to avoid falling victim to another downturn kenneth
[06] clarke the justice secretary has said

[11] mr clarke s stark warning that the country faces a dramatic
[12] 12 months raises the stakes ahead of the review it also
[13] appears at odds with recent comments by david cameron who
[14] suggested that britain was now out of the danger zone
[15] 
[16] mr clarke a former chancellor said the spending review was
[17] quite the most dramatic in living memory and added there s
[18] no one alive who remembers a crisis of this kind
[19] 
[20] i actually am one of those who believes with a grave danger
[21] of financial collapse we re not out of the woods in the
[22] western world yet
[23] 
[24] there is an extremely serious financial crisis
[25] 
[26] he said that the coalition had rescued britain from being
[27] bracketed with the weaker brethren with doubts about our
[28] credit rating and the costs of our borrowing
[29] 
[30] but he added if we fail to deliver with the spending
[31] programme we re going to set out we ll be back there all too
[32] soon so these are quite dramatic changes in spending which we
[33] will hear about next week i would brace yourself for quite a
[34] lot of change because these are difficult circumstances
[35] 
[36] the prime minister used a downing street press conference
[37] earlier this week to warn of dangers to britain s recovery
[38] from abroad but in an interview with the daily telegraph
[39] three weeks ago he suggested that the worst was over
[40] 
[41] he said the argument for rapid action is that it took
[42] britain out of the danger zone we used to be lumped together
[43] with spain and greece we are not any more we are out of that
[44] danger zone
[45] 
[46] last week mr clarke irritated downing street by warning of the
[47] risk of a double dip recession and saying that he was not
[48] sunnily optimistic about the prospects for western
[49] economies
[50] 
[51] mr cameron reacted to those comments made during the
[52] conservative conference by pointing out that the office for
[53] budget responsibility and cbi were both predicting the british
[54] economy would continue to grow
[55] 
[56] george osborne faces a frenetic weekend as he finalises the
[57] spending review to be announced next wednesday which will
[58] see budgets in some whitehall departments cut by as much as 40
[59] per cent the remaining cabinet ministers who have yet to
[60] settle their budgets with the chancellor are expected to do so
[61] by friday
